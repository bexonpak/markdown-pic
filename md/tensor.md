#### Get started with TensorBoard

In machine learning, to improve something you often need to be able to measure it. TensorBoard is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow. It enables tracking experiment metrics like loss and accuracy, visualizing the model graph, projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space, and much more.

This quickstart will show how to quickly get started with TensorBoard. The remaining guides in this website provide more details on specific capabilities, many of which are not included here.
